# ADR-0004: Microservices Architecture Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context

As the HR Management System grows, we need to consider architectural patterns that support:

1. **Scalability**: Different modules have varying resource requirements
   - Attendance tracking has high write throughput
   - Reporting has high read throughput
   - Payroll processing is CPU-intensive with batch operations

2. **Team Organization**: Multiple teams will work on different modules
   - Employee lifecycle team
   - Compensation & benefits team
   - Time & attendance team
   - Each team needs independence in development and deployment

3. **Technology Flexibility**: Different modules may benefit from different technologies
   - Machine learning for recruitment screening
   - Real-time processing for attendance
   - Batch processing for payroll

4. **Deployment Independence**: Critical fixes should be deployable without full system deployment
   - Security patches in authentication
   - Bug fixes in specific modules
   - Performance optimizations

5. **Existing Investment**: We have a working monolithic system
   - Cannot afford big-bang rewrite
   - Need gradual migration path
   - Must maintain system availability during transition

## Decision

We will adopt a **hybrid architecture** that supports both **monolithic** and **microservices** deployment patterns, with a clear migration path from the former to the latter.

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Event-Driven Foundation

**Decision**: Implement event-driven architecture using the Transactional Outbox pattern

**Rationale**:
- Enables loose coupling between modules
- Supports eventual consistency
- Provides audit trail of all business events
- Allows gradual service extraction

**Implementation**:
```
Monolith → Event Outbox → Event Dispatcher → Message Queue → Microservices
```

#### 2. Message Queue: RabbitMQ

**Decision**: Use RabbitMQ as the message broker

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Apache Kafka
- AWS SQS/SNS
- Redis Pub/Sub

**Why RabbitMQ**:
- **Mature and Stable**: Production-proven, 15+ years
- **Feature-Rich**: Routing, dead letter queues, priority queues
- **Easy to Operate**: Good management UI, extensive documentation
- **Lower Latency**: Better for request-response patterns than Kafka
- **Resource Efficient**: Lower overhead than Kafka for our scale
- **AMQP Protocol**: Standard protocol with many client libraries

**When to Consider Kafka**:
- If event replay is critical
- If processing millions of events per second
- If building event sourcing system
- If need distributed log capabilities

#### 3. API Gateway: Kong

**Decision**: Use Kong as API Gateway for microservices

**Alternatives Considered**:
- NGINX
- AWS API Gateway
- Traefik
- Express Gateway

**Why Kong**:
- **Open Source**: No vendor lock-in
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Authentication, rate limiting, monitoring
- **Performance**: Built on NGINX, highly performant
- **Declarative Configuration**: Infrastructure as code
- **Active Community**: Regular updates, good documentation
- **Kubernetes Native**: Works well with K8s ingress

#### 4. Service Discovery: Consul

**Decision**: Use Consul for service discovery and configuration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Kubernetes DNS (built-in)
- etcd
- Eureka

**Why Consul**:
- **Multi-Platform**: Works with Docker, K8s, VMs
- **Health Checking**: Automatic health checks
- **Service Mesh**: Can evolve to Consul Connect
- **Key-Value Store**: Configuration management
- **Multi-Datacenter**: Supports geographic distribution

#### 5. Service Boundaries

**Decision**: Define services based on Domain-Driven Design bounded contexts

**Services**:
1. **Authentication Service**: Identity & access management
2. **Employee Service**: Employee lifecycle
3. **Attendance Service**: Time & attendance tracking
4. **Leave Service**: Leave management
5. **Payroll Service**: Compensation & payroll
6. **Performance Service**: Performance reviews & goals
7. **Recruitment Service**: Hiring & onboarding
8. **Notification Service**: Communications

**Rationale**:
- Each service owns its data (separate databases)
- Clear business domain boundaries
- Minimal cross-service dependencies
- Team alignment with services

### Migration Strategy: Strangler Fig Pattern

**Decision**: Use Strangler Fig pattern for gradual migration

**Phases**:
1. **Phase 1**: Add message queue infrastructure (Keep monolith)
2. **Phase 2**: Extract Notification Service (Low risk, high value)
3. **Phase 3**: Extract core services one by one
4. **Phase 4**: Deploy API Gateway
5. **Phase 5**: Decommission monolith

**Rationale**:
- Minimizes risk
- Allows learning and adaptation
- Maintains system availability
- Can pause or rollback at any phase

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Scalability**
   - Independent scaling of services based on load
   - Cost optimization (scale only what needs scaling)
   - Better resource utilization

2. **Development Velocity**
   - Teams work independently
   - Faster deployment cycles
   - Reduced merge conflicts
   - Technology diversity possible

3. **Resilience**
   - Failure isolation (one service failure doesn't crash system)
   - Independent deployments reduce blast radius
   - Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures

4. **Organizational Alignment**
   - Services align with team structure
   - Clear ownership and responsibility
   - Easier onboarding (smaller codebase per service)

5. **Future Flexibility**
   - Can adopt new technologies per service
   - Easier to replace or rewrite individual services
   - Support for different deployment models (on-premise, cloud, hybrid)

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**
   - More moving parts to manage
   - Distributed system challenges (network latency, partial failures)
   - Requires sophisticated monitoring and observability
   - Debugging is harder across service boundaries

2. **Operational Overhead**
   - More services to deploy and monitor
   - Need for service discovery, API gateway
   - Requires DevOps expertise
   - Infrastructure costs increase

3. **Data Management**
   - No distributed transactions (eventual consistency)
   - Data duplication across services
   - Cross-service queries are complex
   - Need for data synchronization strategies

4. **Network Latency**
   - Service-to-service calls add latency
   - More network hops for operations
   - Need for caching strategies
   - API composition can be slow

5. **Testing Complexity**
   - End-to-end testing is harder
   - Need for contract testing
   - Integration testing across services
   - More test environments needed

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **For Complexity**:
   - Invest in observability (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana)
   - Use correlation IDs for request tracing
   - Implement centralized logging (ELK Stack)
   - Create comprehensive documentation

2. **For Operational Overhead**:
   - Use container orchestration (Kubernetes)
   - Implement CI/CD automation
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm)
   - Invest in monitoring and alerting

3. **For Data Management**:
   - Use event-driven data synchronization
   - Implement CQRS where appropriate
   - Accept eventual consistency
   - Use Saga pattern for distributed transactions

4. **For Network Latency**:
   - Implement caching (Redis)
   - Use async communication where possible
   - API composition at gateway level
   - Optimize service-to-service calls

5. **For Testing**:
   - Implement contract testing (Pact)
   - Use service virtualization for testing
   - Maintain staging environment
   - Automated integration tests

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

```yaml
Message Queue: RabbitMQ 3.x
API Gateway: Kong 3.x
Service Discovery: Consul 1.x
Container Runtime: Docker 24.x
Orchestration: Kubernetes 1.28+
Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

```

### Service Communication

**Synchronous**: REST API over HTTP
- For query operations
- When immediate response needed
- When consistency is critical

**Asynchronous**: Message Queue (RabbitMQ)
- For event notifications
- For long-running operations
- For decoupled processing
- For fire-and-forget scenarios

### Data Strategy

**Database Per Service**: Each service owns its database
- Employee DB
- Attendance DB
- Leave DB
- Payroll DB
- etc.

**Data Synchronization**: Event-driven replication
- Services subscribe to relevant events
- Maintain local read models
- Accept eventual consistency

### Security

**Service-to-Service**:
- JWT validation
- Mutual TLS (future)
- API keys

**Client-to-Service**:
- JWT tokens via API Gateway
- Rate limiting at gateway
- DDoS protection
