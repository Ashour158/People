# ADR-0001: Database Choice - PostgreSQL

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2024-12-07

## Context

The HR Management System requires a robust, reliable, and feature-rich database to handle:

- Complex relational data (employees, departments, attendance, leave, payroll)
- Multi-tenant architecture with organization-level data isolation
- ACID compliance for financial and payroll data
- Advanced querying capabilities for reporting and analytics
- Support for concurrent users and transactions
- JSON data types for flexible schema extensions
- Full-text search capabilities
- Strong data integrity constraints

We evaluated several database options:

1. **PostgreSQL** - Open-source relational database
2. **MySQL** - Popular open-source relational database
3. **MongoDB** - NoSQL document database
4. **Microsoft SQL Server** - Commercial relational database

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL 15+** as our primary database for the following reasons:

### Technical Superiority

1. **Advanced Features**:
   - Native UUID support with `gen_random_uuid()`
   - JSONB data type for semi-structured data
   - Array data types
   - Full-text search with tsvector
   - Window functions for complex analytics
   - CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex queries
   - Materialized views for performance optimization

2. **ACID Compliance**:
   - Strong consistency guarantees
   - Critical for payroll and financial data
   - Reliable transaction handling

3. **Extensibility**:
   - Rich ecosystem of extensions (PostGIS, pg_trgm, etc.)
   - Custom data types and functions
   - Procedural languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python)

4. **Performance**:
   - Excellent query optimizer
   - Efficient indexing (B-tree, Hash, GiST, GIN, BRIN)
   - Connection pooling support (PgBouncer)
   - Partitioning support for large tables

5. **Multi-tenancy Support**:
   - Row-level security (RLS)
   - Schema-based isolation options
   - Excellent for organization_id filtering

### Operational Benefits

1. **Open Source**:
   - No licensing costs
   - Active community support
   - Regular security updates

2. **Reliability**:
   - Proven track record in production
   - Used by major companies (Instagram, Spotify, Reddit)
   - Excellent documentation

3. **Ecosystem**:
   - Wide tooling support (pgAdmin, DBeaver)
   - Cloud hosting options (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database)
   - ORM support (TypeORM, Prisma, Sequelize)

4. **Migration Path**:
   - Built-in logical replication
   - pg_dump/pg_restore for backups
   - Multiple upgrade strategies

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Strong data integrity**: Foreign keys, constraints, and ACID compliance prevent data corruption
- **Rich query capabilities**: Complex reports and analytics are straightforward
- **JSON support**: Flexible schema for custom fields without migrations
- **Mature ecosystem**: Extensive tooling and community support
- **Cost-effective**: No licensing fees, suitable for all deployment sizes
- **Performance**: Handles millions of records efficiently with proper indexing
- **Multi-tenant ready**: Built-in features for data isolation

### Negative

- **Complexity**: More complex than MySQL for simple use cases
- **Resource usage**: Can be memory-intensive under heavy load
- **Learning curve**: Requires understanding of advanced features for optimization
- **Operational overhead**: Requires proper configuration for production (vacuuming, connection pooling)

### Neutral

- **SQL-based**: Team needs SQL expertise (vs NoSQL alternatives)
- **Relational model**: Schema must be well-designed upfront
- **Migration management**: Schema changes require careful planning

## Alternatives Considered

### MySQL

**Pros**:
- Simpler to set up and maintain
- Slightly faster for simple read-heavy workloads
- More widespread adoption

**Cons**:
- Fewer advanced features (no native UUID, limited JSON support)
- Weaker transaction guarantees in some storage engines
- Less suitable for complex analytics

**Decision**: Rejected due to lack of advanced features needed for HR domain

### MongoDB

**Pros**:
- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scaling
- JSON-native

**Cons**:
- Eventual consistency (not suitable for payroll)
- Limited transaction support (improved in v4+)
- Weak relationship modeling
- Not suitable for relational HR data

**Decision**: Rejected due to HR data being inherently relational

### Microsoft SQL Server

**Pros**:
- Enterprise features
- Excellent tooling
- Strong performance

**Cons**:
- Licensing costs (significant for multi-tenant SaaS)
- Less cloud-portable
- Limited Linux support compared to PostgreSQL

**Decision**: Rejected due to licensing costs and vendor lock-in

## Implementation Details

### Version

- **Minimum**: PostgreSQL 15.0
- **Recommended**: PostgreSQL 15.3+

### Key Features Used

1. **UUID Primary Keys**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
     employee_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
   );
   ```

2. **JSONB for Flexible Data**:
   ```sql
   custom_fields JSONB
   ```

3. **Full-Text Search**:
   ```sql
   search_vector TSVECTOR GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
     to_tsvector('english', first_name || ' ' || last_name || ' ' || email)
   ) STORED
   ```

4. **Row-Level Security**:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY organization_isolation ON employees
   FOR ALL TO app_user
   USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::uuid);
   ```

### Connection Management

- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer or pgpool-II)
- Default pool size: 10-20 connections per backend instance
- Max pool size: Based on CPU cores (typically 2-4x cores)

### Backup Strategy

- Daily full backups using pg_dump
- Point-in-time recovery using WAL archiving
- Retention: 30 days for compliance

### Monitoring

- Track query performance with pg_stat_statements
- Monitor connection counts and locks
- Set up alerts for long-running queries
