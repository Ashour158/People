### Test Markers

Tests are organized with pytest markers:
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Slow running tests
- `@pytest.mark.auth` - Authentication tests
- `@pytest.mark.employee` - Employee tests
- `@pytest.mark.attendance` - Attendance tests
- `@pytest.mark.leave` - Leave tests
- `@pytest.mark.payroll` - Payroll tests
- `@pytest.mark.performance` - Performance tests

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd python_backend
pytest
```

### Run with Coverage Report
```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Run Specific Module Tests
```bash
pytest tests/test_auth.py
pytest tests/test_employees.py
pytest tests/test_attendance.py
```

### Run Tests by Marker
```bash
pytest -m auth
pytest -m integration
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Run with Verbose Output
```bash
pytest -v
pytest -vv  # Very verbose
```

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 10
- **Total Test Cases**: 123+
- **Lines of Test Code**: ~7,500+
- **Test Configuration Lines**: ~180
- **Coverage Target**: 80%

## Test Patterns Used

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)** pattern
2. **Given-When-Then** structure
3. **Test isolation** with fixtures
4. **Mocking** external dependencies (where needed)
5. **Parametrized tests** for multiple scenarios
6. **Error case testing** alongside happy paths

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test infrastructure complete
2. ⏳ Install Python dependencies
3. ⏳ Run test suite and measure coverage
4. ⏳ Fix any failing tests
5. ⏳ Add additional tests to reach 80% coverage
6. ⏳ Set up CI/CD with test gates
7. ⏳ Add performance and load tests

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow (Recommended)

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd python_backend
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd python_backend
          pytest --cov=app --cov-report=xml
      
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Test Quality Checklist

- [x] Tests are independent and isolated
- [x] Tests use descriptive names
- [x] Tests cover happy paths
- [x] Tests cover error cases
- [x] Tests use fixtures appropriately
- [x] Tests are well-organized by module
- [x] Tests include documentation
- [x] Tests are fast (in-memory database)

## Maintenance

- **Add tests** for new features before implementing
- **Update tests** when API changes
- **Review test coverage** regularly
- **Refactor tests** as needed
- **Keep fixtures** up to date with models
