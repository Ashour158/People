**Impact:** Anyone can forge JWT tokens, access database  
**Fix Time:** 2 hours  
**Status:** 🚨 BLOCKS PRODUCTION

```python
# ❌ CURRENT (INSECURE)
SECRET_KEY: str = "your-secret-key-change-this-in-production"
JWT_SECRET_KEY: str = "your-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production"

# ✅ REQUIRED FIX
SECRET_KEY: str  # Load from environment, no default
JWT_SECRET_KEY: str  # Load from environment, no default
```

### 2. 🔴 **HIGH: Missing Database Migrations**
**Impact:** Cannot deploy database properly  
**Fix Time:** 8 hours  
**Affected:** 9+ models without migrations

### 3. 🔴 **HIGH: No Database Indexes**

**Target:** 80%  
**Fix Time:** 40 hours  
**Impact:** High risk of regressions

### 5. 🔴 **HIGH: Missing Transaction Management**
**Location:** `python_backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`  
**Impact:** Risk of orphaned database records  
**Fix Time:** 4 hours

### 6. 🔴 **HIGH: Weak JWT Security**
**Current:** 24-hour token expiry  
**Required:** 15-30 minutes  
**Fix Time:** 1 hour
